I currently hold a Researcher and Assistant Professor (non-tenure) position in Computer Science at the Ca' Foscari University of Venice, Italy. My interests range from programming languages to software engineering, strongly emphasising type systems, compilers, software verification and coding methodologies.

During my research career I also explored other topics, such as Software Engineering and Security. Recently I have been working on the blockchain and languages for writing smart contracts. Among my research projects, a novel functional programming language was created by me, named Lw, with advanced features and forms of polymorphism. You can peek at this and other projects of mine on my personal GitHub repository.

Before my academic career, I had a career as a software developer. I spent more than 15 years as a professional developer for the industry, including years as an active open-source developer and a demoscene coder for the Amiga in the 90s.
