I currently hold a Researcher and Assistant Professor (non-tenure) position in Computer Science at the Ca' Foscari University of Venice, Italy. My interests range from programming languages to software engineering, strongly emphasising type systems, compilers, software verification and coding methodologies.

During my research career I also explored other topics, such as Software Engineering and Security. Recently I have been working on the blockchain and languages for writing smart contracts. Among my research projects, a novel functional programming language was created by me, named Lw, with advanced features and forms of polymorphism. You can peek at this and other projects of mine on my personal GitHub repository.

Before my academic career, I had a career as a software developer. I spent more than 15 years as a professional developer for the industry, including years as an active open-source developer and a demoscene coder for the Amiga in the 90s.

I started career as a Ph.D. student at Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, where the primary research area belongs from the domains of taint analysis, relational tainting, static analysis, abstract interpretation, and program verification. I received both of my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Calcutta, India. 

My master’s thesis, titled as “Incorporating Multiple Bioassay and Cross Contamination Avoidance in Digital Microfluidic Biochip ”, centered around the Digital Microfluidic Biochips (DMFBs), commonly referred to as lab-on-a-chip where the research includes VLSI design. The design of a compact chip measuring 15×15 with a mere 13 pins was presented. This chip effectively integrates three distinct assay operations: nPI, PCR, and In-Vitro diagnostics, demonstrating promising completion times compared to existing commercial biochips. By reducing the overall pin count and improving the utilization factor, the chip becomes more cost-effective. Additionally, the routing scheme implemented ensures proficient prevention of cross-contamination issues while maintaining fluidic constraints. 

I worked as a research fellow at Ca'Foscari University of Venice in the domain of “Data User Security Trust” where the experiment was based on the data leakage static analysis of python scripts extracted from jupyter notebooks containing sensitive Information of public administration using static analyzer LiSA (Library for Static Analysis).
