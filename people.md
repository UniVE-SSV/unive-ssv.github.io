Pietro Ferrara is an expert of static analysis based on the abstract interpretation theory with a focus on the detection of security vulnerabilities and privacy leaks in object-oriented programs.

He joined the University of Venice in November 2019 as a tenure-track assistant professor, and he became associate professor in November 2022. Previously, from 2013 to 2019, he worked in industry gaining experience in delivering prototypes and commercial tools to customers filling the gap between scientific research and development, and delivery of software products, as well as technical and commercial presentation to customers, evaluation activities, and preparation of commercial and technical documentation.

In particular, he was the Head of Research and Development at JuliaSoft SRL (a spin-off of University of Verona focused on the static analysis of Java, Android, and .NET programs) from February 2016 to November 2019 where he supervised the development of the scientific core of an industrial static analyzer and the dissemination of its scientific results. He was a Research Staff Member in the group of Mobile Enterprise Software led by Marco Pistoia from July 2013 to December 2015, and a lecturer at ETH of Zurich in the Programming methodology group under the supervision of Peter Mueller from April 2009 to July 2013. He obtained my PhD degree in Computer Science from the Ecole Polytechnique of Paris and the Universita’ Ca’ Foscari of Venice on May, 22nd 2009. His PhD thesis advisors were Radhia Cousot and Agostino Cortesi. He defended his PhD thesis on May 22nd, 2009 at the Ecole Normale Superiore. In addition, he was an intern at Microsoft Research in Redmond in the PLA group from August 20th 2007 to November 9th 2007 under the supervision of Francesco Logozzo.

I got a Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees at the University of Verona, followed by a five years industrial experience on development and applications of Static Analysis and Abstract Interpretation with the Julia static analyzer. I got my PhD in Computer Science in January 2023 at the Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, focusing on Multi-language Static Analysis. I then joined Ca' Foscari as a research fellow, and I am currently an Assistant Professor (non-tenure) there.

Giacomo Boldini is a Ph.D. student at Ca' Foscari University of Venice, where his primary research interests lie in the domains of static analysis, abstract interpretation, and program verification. He obtained both his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science at the University of Parma. His Master's thesis, titled "Source code clustering via explainable code similarity based on control flow graph features", centered around source code similarity and the development of explainable source code representation designed to facilitate machine learning methodologies in understanding code features and their similarities. During his Master's degree at the University of Parma, he also worked on a project involving the optimization and parallelization of code, leveraging the power of NVIDIA GPUs and the CUDA programming model to enhance the performance of numerical analysis algorithms.

I started career as a Ph.D. student at Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, where the primary research area belongs from the domains of taint analysis, relational tainting, static analysis, abstract interpretation, and program verification. I received both of my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Calcutta, India. 

My master’s thesis, titled as “Incorporating Multiple Bioassay and Cross Contamination Avoidance in Digital Microfluidic Biochip ”, centered around the Digital Microfluidic Biochips (DMFBs), commonly referred to as lab-on-a-chip where the research includes VLSI design. The design of a compact chip measuring 15×15 with a mere 13 pins was presented. This chip effectively integrates three distinct assay operations: nPI, PCR, and In-Vitro diagnostics, demonstrating promising completion times compared to existing commercial biochips. By reducing the overall pin count and improving the utilization factor, the chip becomes more cost-effective. Additionally, the routing scheme implemented ensures proficient prevention of cross-contamination issues while maintaining fluidic constraints. 

I worked as a research fellow at Ca'Foscari University of Venice in the domain of “Data User Security Trust” where the experiment was based on the data leakage static analysis of python scripts extracted from jupyter notebooks containing sensitive Information of public administration using static analyzer LiSA (Library for Static Analysis).

Vincenzo Arceri has a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science (July 2014) and a Master Degree in Computer Science and Engineering – Computer Systems Security curriculum – (July 2016), both issued by the University of Verona. He was an UROP Student at the Imperial College London (Summer 2016), under the supervision of Prof. Sergio Maffeis. Vincenzo Arceri joined the University of Verona in October 2016 as PhD student in Computer Science, under the supervision of Prof. Isabella Mastroeni and he got the PhD in May 2020, defending my PhD thesis titled “Taming Strings in Dynamic Languages – An Abstract Interpretation-based Static Analysis Approach”. From September 2019 to September 2021, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the Ca’ Foscari University of Venice in the Software and System Verification research group. 

Currently, Vincenzo Arceri is an Assistant Professor (non-tenure) in the Department of Mathematical, Physical, and Computer Sciences at the University of Parma, dealing with techniques to speed up static analyses, static analysis of Go language for blockchain applications, relational string analyses, and static analysis for dynamic languages.

Vincenzo Arceri's main research interests include static program analysis, string analysis and verification (in particular for dynamic languages), abstract interpretation and, more in general, formal methods for program security.
