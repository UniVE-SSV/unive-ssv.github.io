I got a Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees at the University of Verona. I got in touch with JuliaSoft during my Master’s thesis, and that was the place where I got interested in Abstract Interpretation. I was a developer of the Julia static analyzer in JuliaSoft from April 2018 to June 2023. I got my PhD in Computer Science in January 2023, focusing on Multi-language Static Analysis, at the Ca’ Foscari University of Venice. Since July 2023, I am a research fellow there.
