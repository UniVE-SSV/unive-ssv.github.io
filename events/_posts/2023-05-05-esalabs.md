There are a large number of highly important applications that currently rely upon data from satellites and space missions, ranging from weather prediction to monitoring of environmental pollution, climate change, marine traffic, agriculture & urban planning, etc.

The quality and quantity of space data poses new and specific challenges to the scientific community, covering the entire life-cycle of space data management and with a need for an interdisciplinary approach.

The aim of this workshop is to strengthen the collaboration among the ESA_Lab partners by sharing their latest results that impact these issues, and by collecting the problems that emerge from ESA activities that can stimulate new research.
