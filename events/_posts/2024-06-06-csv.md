**June 6-7, 2024, Venice, Italy**

Following the success of [CSV 22]({% link events/_posts/2022-05-20-csv.md %}) and [CSV 23]({% link events/_posts/2023-05-25-csv.md %}), the Symposium on "Challenges of Software Verification" will take place on Thursday 6th and Friday 7th June 2024 in the [Aula Baratto](https://www.unive.it/pag/30119/) of Ca’ Foscari University of Venice. The 2-day event will be organized in several sessions. The scope of the symposium will cover theoretical results in the field of software verification, their practical applications, novel and innovative tools, and their impact of software verification in software engineering and DevOps practices. The symposium will not have published proceedings, but authors of selected abstracts will be invited to submit a full paper to a special issue of the Springer [International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer](https://www.springer.com/journal/10009). The extended version of the talks presented at CSV 2022 has been published in [Springer-Nature](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-19-9601-6), while the articles submitted at CSV 2023 are currently under review for a special issue of the Springer-Nature International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer.
